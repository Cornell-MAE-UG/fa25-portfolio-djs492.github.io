For a class, we were asked to perform a thermodynamic analysis on a real-world device. I chose the Pratt & Whitney FW-100-EQ medium bypass turbofan, a jet engine used in several aircaft including variants of the F-15 and F-16

The FW-100 is a medium-bypass turbofan engine. The operating principle of the FW-100 is as follows:

A fan at the engine's intake draws in air at the ambient pressure, with most of the air being drawn into a compressor, while some of it is drawn into bypass ducts. The compressor compresses the incoming air before feeding it into the combustion chamber, where it is mixed with jet fuel. The resulting mixture is ignited, and the expanding gas drives a turbine, which provides some power back into the fan and compressor. The outflow mixture is then sent out of a nozzle, producing thrust.

Each of the segments (fan, compressor, burner, turbine) can be modeled as a control volume (CV) system, with the CV being the inside of the engine duct.

For all of the five segments below, let us assume that the aircraft is parked at sea level and NTP (v<sub>inlet</sub>=0; P<sub>inlet</sub>=P<sub>atm</sub>=101.3kPa; T<sub>inlet</sub>=293°K). Also assume air is an ideal gas.


The fan is a CV system that draws in air from the inlet, takes work from the engine's main shaft, and outputs air out to the bypass and core ducts. We will assume that the fan is adiabatic. From the specs of the FW-100, the Fan Pressure Ratio(FPR) is 3.04, the inlet mass flow rate is 112.7kg/s. and the engine's bypass ratio BPR is 0.36. The inlet has a diameter of 0.88m, or a cross-section of 0.6082m^2.

The compressor is a CV system that takes the airflow from the core duct, takes work from the engine's main shaft, and outputs air out to the burner. Unlike the fan and turbine, we will not assume the compressor is adiabatic. From the specs of the FW-100, the operating pressure ratio(OPR), or the ratio between inlet and compressor pressure, is 32.4.

The burner is a CV system that takes the compressed airflow, adds energy from burning fuel, and then expels it to the turbine. The F-100 has a burner pressure ratio of 0.99, meaning that the burner's outlet pressure is 0.99 times that of the inlet pressure. The burner's exit temperature is given as 1620°K

The turbine is a CV system that takes the hot air from the burner at the burner's exit temperature, has a work output, and rejects the airflow to the nozzle. We will assume that the turbine is adiabatic. The turbine's work output is to the same shaft as the fan and compressor's input, and it is assumed that it has a 3% loss. 

Below are specifications for key engine parameters at six key points along the engine <sup>[1],[2],[3]</sup>. Assume potential energy is neglegible. Assume

Using these specs, we can use an energy balance to calculate the energy of each component and an entropy balance to calculate the change in each component.

No distinction is made between entropy generated by boundary and entropy generated within the system, as many details of the system's internals are not readily available.

These values differ from the real engine mainly due to the assumptions that the fan & turbine are isentropic, and because of mechanical inefficiencies that are not accounted for here.
