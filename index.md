## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Dylan Shen, and I am a current Cornell Mechanical Engineering student and Hunter R. Rawlings Presidential Research Scholar. Having conducted research with both the Bonassar Lab at Cornell and the Terrer Lab at MIT, I bring a strong technical foundation and hands-on research experience spanning biomechanics, satellite imagery, and algorithm development. With proficiency in Python, MATLAB, Fusion, LaTeX, and advanced laboratory tools, I pair analytical rigor with creativity and initiative. Outside the lab, I lead and teach in Cornell's Ring of Steel chapter, sharpening communication, mentoring, and interpersonnel skills in a high-intensity environment. I’m driven, adaptable, and eager to apply my interdisciplinary engineering and research background to meaningful, impact-focused projects.
